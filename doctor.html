                Doctors, nurses and people working in health-care sectors are particularly vulnerable to the highly infectious disease. 
                In response to the global pandemic, the under-resourced doctors are facing unprecedented challenges. The list of the sleep-deprived heroes 
                includes doctors, nurses, medical cleaners, pathologists, paramedics, ambulance drivers, and health-care administrators. In the fight against 
                coronavirus, the brave medical army stands strong with thermometers, stethoscopes, and ventilators as their weapons. Not to forget, medical 
                researchers are working day in and night out against all odds, hoping to find the antidote to the disease

                Since the coronavirus outbreak, health-care professionals have not only experienced the gratification of healing patients and saving their 
                lives but have also lost many battles along the way. On top of that, many doctors have even sacrificed their own lives in the line of duty
