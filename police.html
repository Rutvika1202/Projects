                The lockdown poses great burdens on frontline police officers in India For the police, the lockdown creates tinderbox conditions. 
                Frontline officers expect some violations of lockdown rules, but their aim is to prevent even worse outcomes, such as large-scale violence 
                and breakdowns of public order. With respect to capacity, the Indian police have long been starved of personnel and resources. India’s police to 
                population ratio is 193 to 100,000 — much lower than in other countries. Of the total police budget, 80-90 per cent goes toward personnel costs. 
                Another 10 per cent covers routine maintenance.

                India’s public health response to Covid-19 engages two distinct police functions: the maintenance of public order and social service 
                provision.
            </b></p>
            <p><b>
                After the lockdown order, police agencies aggressively enforced social distancing through patrolling vans, foot patrols, and vehicular checkpoints. 
                These techniques follow a conventional “law and order” paradigm, which is engrained into the training and organisational culture of the police.
