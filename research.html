                 Using their prototype coronavirus, the researchers studied the spike protein, which appears on the surface of coronaviruses. These spikes let the coronavirus latch
                 onto cells in our body. When the body’s immune system sees the spike protein, it makes antibodies to try to protect the body from infection. This makes it a good 
                vaccine target.

                 The COVID-19 outbreak in China was first reported publicly on December 31, 2019. By the second week of January 2020, 
                researchers in China published the DNA sequence of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
